# MiniMapTEMP
a temporary repository for the mini map (it is a long story, next time I am at robotics I will work on transitioning this to the actual robot code)
Testbot = sensor values (may need to adjust somethings)
ignore the folders in the minimap folder

to moveForward - alt + w
to turn - alt+a or alt+d

the best spot for an encoder for this to work would be on a swivel wheel in the center of the robot

I also need to fix the reference points, 


I plan on transfering this to the actual 2019 robot code workspace, it is a long story but this was essentially the best 
work around I could think of. Once they are transfered this repository will probably be deleted. Sorry for any confusion or annoyance caused
by this.
